# MemeBattle

## Introduction
Create the best Meme and win the game!

We were motivated to create MemeBattle to build a community-centric, interactive, creative and entertaining online game.

### Technologies used

For the MemeBattle Webapplication we used the following technologies:

- Frontend Development: HMTL, CSS, React, Imgflip API
- Backend Development: Java, Springboot, RESTful API, Imgflip API
- Deployment and Hosting: Google Cloud and Docker
- Testing: Mockito and JUnit Tests
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### High-level Components
If you consider to use IntelliJ as your IDE of choice, you can make use of your free educational license [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
1. Lobby: //TODO
2. User: //TODO
3. Meme: //TODO


### Launch & Deployment
The following extensions can help you get started more easily:
-   `vmware.vscode-spring-boot`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard`
-   `vscjava.vscode-java-pack`

**Note:** You'll need to build the project first with Gradle, just click on the `build` command in the _Gradle Tasks_ extension. Then check the _Spring Boot Dashboard_ extension if it already shows `soprafs24` and hit the play button to start the server. If it doesn't show up, restart VS Code and check again.

### Roadmap
You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.
-   macOS: `./gradlew`
-   Linux: `./gradlew`
-   Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

More Information about [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/docs/).

### Authors and acknowledgment
Authors: Jana Joy Anja Muheim, Marc Timothy Huber, Marc Theodor Felix Amsler, Christof Markus Steiner, Gian Seifert

Acknowledgment: We want to thank the UZH and Prof. Fritz for offering the SoPra module. Without this module MemeBattle most likely would'nt exist. Furthermore, we want to say a big thanks to our tutor Miro Vannini. With his important and well-thought inputs MemeBattle wouldn't be what it is today.
