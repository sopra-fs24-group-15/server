# MemeBattle

## Introduction
Create the best Meme and win the game!

We were motivated to create MemeBattle to build a community-centric, interactive, creative and entertaining online game.

### Technologies used

For the MemeBattle Webapplication we used the following technologies:

- Frontend Development: HMTL, CSS, React, Imgflip API
- Backend Development: Java, Springboot, RESTful API, Imgflip API
- Deployment and Hosting: Google Cloud and Docker
- Testing: Mockito and JUnit Tests
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### High-level Components
If you consider to use IntelliJ as your IDE of choice, you can make use of your free educational license [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

2. User: //TODO
3. Meme: //TODO


### Launch & Deployment

Make sure you have the required Software installed:
for our project this includes Java 17 (for Windows, also make sure that your **JAVA_HOME** environment variable is set to the correct version of Java).

Then start by cloning the Repository:

```bash
git clone ....
```

To build the application you can use the local Gradle Wrapper:


Install Project Dependencies once before first starting the Application:
```bash
npm install
```

Next, you can start the app with:
```bash
npm run dev
```




The following extensions can help you get started more easily:
-   `vmware.vscode-spring-boot`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard`
-   `vscjava.vscode-java-pack`

**Note:** You'll need to build the project first with Gradle, just click on the `build` command in the _Gradle Tasks_ extension. Then check the _Spring Boot Dashboard_ extension if it already shows `soprafs24` and hit the play button to start the server. If it doesn't show up, restart VS Code and check again.

### Roadmap
MemeBattle currently consists of two GameModes. There are many more possible GameModes to implement. This could for example be a  Gamemode where Users can choose Pictures from their own gallery as the Template or where users could write a Topic themselves.

### Authors and acknowledgment
Authors: Jana Muheim, Marc Huber, Marc Amsler, Christof Steiner, Gian Seifert

Acknowledgment: We want to thank the UZH and Prof. Fritz for offering the SoPra module. Without this module MemeBattle most likely would'nt exist. Furthermore, we want to say a big thanks to our tutor Miro Vannini. With his important and well-thought inputs MemeBattle wouldn't be what it is today.
